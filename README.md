# Cireclegon2
An old framework for live audio and MIDI reactive performance visuals developed in Processing

The framework instantiates a fullscreen window on a secondary monitor and a small debug console window on the main monitor.

Visuals are separated into 'worlds'. The fullscreen window will render and update the currently active world, which can feature various entities or draw to the screen with GLSL shaders. You can switch to a different world at any time.

This was developed a very very long time ago, excuse the bad code!
